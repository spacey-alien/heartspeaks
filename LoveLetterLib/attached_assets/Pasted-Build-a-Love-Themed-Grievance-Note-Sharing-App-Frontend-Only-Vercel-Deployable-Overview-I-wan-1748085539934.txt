Build a Love-Themed Grievance Note-Sharing App (Frontend-Only, Vercel Deployable)”
📌 Overview
I want to build a frontend-only grievance note app hosted on Vercel, designed with feminine/love psychology colors (soft pink, rose, lavender, blush). The app lets my girlfriend submit a grievance (title, problem, mood, and suggested solution). On submission, a unique shareable link is generated (with the data encoded into the URL or stored in localStorage/query string). When I open that link, I can view her message in a sweetly designed note-style page. No backend, no database — fully serverless.

✅ Pages
1. index.html – Submit Complaint Page
Form fields:

Title of the grievance

What’s bothering you?

Current mood (emoji dropdown or colored buttons)

Suggested fix

A cute “Send with Love 💌” button

After submission:

Encode all fields into URL (e.g., /note.html?title=...&mood=...&problem=...)

Show a link she can copy/share (auto copy to clipboard with "Link copied 💗" toast)

Pastel UI:

Rounded inputs, soft shadows

Colors: soft pinks, peach, baby purple

Cute heart icon header, warm fonts like Quicksand, Poppins

2. note.html – Read-Only Note View
Parse query parameters from the link (e.g., note.html?title=...)

Display the grievance in note/paper/card layout:

Use handwriting-style font for content (like Dancing Script)

Display:

Title 💌

Mood emoji

Problem (styled like a journal entry)

Suggested solution (optional section)

Date generated (use new Date() to append timestamp)

Decorative hearts or flower patterns in the background

Button: “Send her a hug 💞” (can be fake or animated)

✨ Styling Details
Use TailwindCSS or plain CSS with:

#ffd6e8 (blush pink), #ffe5f0 (light rose), #e7d3f7 (lavender) for backgrounds

Rounded corners (border-radius: 20px)

Drop shadows, soft animations

Heart emoji headers and animations (e.g., floating hearts)

🧠 Logic / Functionality
All data is encoded via URL query parameters (safe for frontend only)

Example generated URL:

/note.html?title=Feeling+Ignored&mood=😔&problem=You+didn't+text+me+back...&solution=Just+a+call+would+make+me+smile.

🚀 Hosting on Vercel
Just connect the GitHub repo to Vercel

No backend, no build step — static deployment

🧾 Expected User Flow
She visits index.html and fills in her complaint

Clicks “Send with Love 💌”

Gets a shareable link like:

Copy
Edit
https://heartspeak.vercel.app/note.html?title=Silent+Treatment&mood=😔&problem=Felt+lonely...
You open the link — you see a beautiful love-themed note with her full complaint and mood

💡 Bonus Ideas (optional):
Add “🌈 Mood Bubble” background that changes based on selected mood

Allow her to upload a selfie or choose a love-themed sticker to attach

Show “💗 Heart Count” — number of complaints submitted this month (via localStorage)
